## Purpose & Community Value

High-quality Chinese input configurations are often scattered, hard to reuse, and poorly documented.  
This project aims to:

- Centralize reusable RIME / Trime resources
- Reduce configuration complexity for new users
- Provide stable base configurations for developers and maintainers
- Improve cross-platform consistency

It serves both ordinary users and developers who build custom input solutions.

## Planned Cloudflare Usage

Cloudflare services will be used to improve global accessibility and automation:

- **Cloudflare Pages**  
  For hosting documentation and configuration previews.

- **Cloudflare Workers**  
  For automated configuration building, version control, and API-based distribution.

- **Cloudflare R2 + CDN**  
  For stable, low-latency global downloads.

The main motivation is to avoid unstable access and bandwidth limitations of traditional public hosting platforms.
